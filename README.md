Temporal link prediction using SVD

This description is taken from the homework description given by Evrim Acar:

This exercise is about using the Singular Value Decomposition for the temporal link prediction problem. When you load hw1 data.mat, you will see two data sets, i.e., X and Y. X shows the number of papers published by authors at various conferences between 1991 and 2004. It is of size 471 (authors) × 366 (conferences) × 14 (years). Given X, we want to predict who is going to publish at which conference in 2005. Matrix Y shows the ground truth, i.e., publications in 2005.
